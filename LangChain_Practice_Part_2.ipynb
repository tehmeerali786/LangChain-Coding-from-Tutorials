            "Captain Grace Hopper, a mathematical genius, helped usher in the computer revolution during World War II. She left her professorship at Vassar to join the Navy Reserve and worked on the first computer, Mark 1. Hopper believes we are still in the early stages of the computer revolution, likening it to the Model T stage of development. Her work on computer languages enabled machines to understand and speak human languages. Today's computers can perform trillions of calculations per second, and Hopper emphasizes the importance of understanding the scale of these speeds. She is central to the ongoing revolution, helping the Navy manage resources and target missiles. Her dedication to the Navy stems from her family's naval history and her personal preference for blue.\n"
